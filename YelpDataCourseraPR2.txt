Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM table

i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. 
If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(key))
FROM table

i. Business = id 10000
ii. Hours = business_id 1562
iii. Category = business_id 2643
iv. Attribute = business_id 1115
v. Review = id 10000 business_id 8090 user_id 9581
vi. Checkin = business_id 493
vii. Photo = id 10000 business_id 6493
viii. Tip = user_id 537 business_id 3979
ix. User = id 10000
x. Friend = user_id 11
xi. Elite_years = user_id 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

	Picked city Las Vegas and category Food. The query returned 3 businesses.

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

	No, the two groups do not have very different distribution of hours. 
	They are all open 7 days a week and for a pretty large portion of the day.
	The 3 star business is open 11am to midnight daily. 
	The 4 star businesses are open 10/11am to 8/11pm on most days.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         
	Difficult to say with just 3 businesses in the sample. 
	The 3 star business had 123 reviews. The 4 star businesses had
	168 and 768 reviews.

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

	Each business is located in a different postal code. 
	Location may contribute to the popularity as based on the number of reviews 
	for the business.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT business.name, business.city, category.category, business.stars, 
  hours.hours, business.review_count, business.postal_code,
  case								
  when stars >= 2 and stars <= 3 then '2-3 stars'
  when stars >= 4 and stars <= 5 then '4-5 stars'
  else NULL
end star_group
FROM (business inner join category on business.id = category.business_id)
inner join hours on hours.business_id = category.business_id
WHERE business.city LIKE "Las Vegas" AND category.category LIKE "Restaurants"

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         
	Businesses that are open on average have more reviews than businesses that are closed.
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
    Businesses that are open on average have slightly higher number of stars.    
         
SQL code used for analysis:

	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)),
			AVG(review_count),
			AVG(stars),
			is_open
	FROM business
	GROUP BY is_open

+---------------------+-------------------+---------------+---------+
| COUNT(DISTINCT(id)) | AVG(review_count) |    AVG(stars) | is_open |
+---------------------+-------------------+---------------+---------+
|                1520 |     23.1980263158 | 3.52039473684 |       0 |
|                8480 |     31.7570754717 | 3.67900943396 |       1 |

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis 
you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, 
clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, 
predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, 
and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, 
so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. 
Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis 
and why you chose that data:

The analysis will be to identify that common business attributes among businesses that receive 
high star ratings or large number of reviews. The dataset was created by doing an inner join 
between the business table and the attributes table. In addition, the dataset was limited to
only businesses that are still open.
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
